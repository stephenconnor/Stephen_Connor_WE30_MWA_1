A monocoque front triangle makes it tough and light, while lugged seat stays and chain stays maximise tyre clearance. The lightness will also be appreciated when shouldering the Cross Prestige, as will the unique support between the top tube and seat tube developed at Sven Nysâ€™s request to increase carrying comfort when on the shoulder.",
